# Setup

For firebase hosting, configure your project API keys for src/firebase.js and in .env.local file (remove .example from filename) or disable firebase all together.

Use "npm install", "npm run build" & "npm run start" before deploying react app to azure/firebase/hosting

More details to get started are here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup and here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.

You need to set up Cloud Firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and Cloud Function for Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) for the back-end functionality.

Where, Firestore stores the secret words and Function does the communication with bing or google translate for input validation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/ or https://cloud.google.com/translate/)
