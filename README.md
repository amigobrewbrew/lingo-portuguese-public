# Setup

Change the name of firebaseUpdateAndRenameThis.js to firebase.js and add your project API keys there for your firebase project.

More details to get started are here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup and here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html.

You need to set up Could Firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and Cloud Function for Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) for the back-end functionality.

Where, Firestore stores the secret words and Function does the communication with bing or google translate for input validation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/ or https://cloud.google.com/translate/)
